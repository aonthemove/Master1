# Creating a Project Site

## Instructions

Make a simple website about your favorite type of animal.

1. Create a header that will act as a title for the page
2. Create a few short paragraphs describing the animal's best characteristics. 
3. Include at least one picture of the animal
4. Once you have created your HTML add, commit, and push your files up to GitHub Pages.
5. Make sure to navigate to your page in the web browser to ensure your website is live

**Guide:**

1. Create a new repository on your GitHub account. _You can name this repository whatever you would like._
2. Clone this repository and navigate to the project folder in your code editor.
3. Once inside of the repository, create a new file and name it `index.html`
4. Add your HTML into this file, save it, and add, commit, and push the file to GitHub.
5. On GitHub, navigate into your repository's Settings tab.
6. Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section and then, in the section labeled `Source`, select that you would like to use the `master` branch as your source.
7. Navigate to `<<YOUR USERNAME>>.github.io/<<REPO NAME YOU CHOSE>>` and you will find that your new web page has gone live! (For example, if your GitHub username is `johndoe` and the project is `cssDemo`, your URL would be `johndoe.github.io/cssDemo`) 
8. Slack out a link to your deployed page! Congratulations, you're page is now live!

## Challenge

Create additional html pages and create links from `index.html` to your new html pages.

Have some fun! Test your HTML and CSS skills by going above and beyond with your page!
