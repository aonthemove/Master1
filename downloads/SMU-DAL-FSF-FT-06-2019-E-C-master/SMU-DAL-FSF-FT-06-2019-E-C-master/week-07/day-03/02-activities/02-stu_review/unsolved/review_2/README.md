# Relative File Paths Review Activity

## Instructions

**_Activity Two:_**

1. Using one of the Github repositories created from Activity One, create an `index.html`.
2. Create a `style.css` at the root of the directory (so that it's adjacent to `index.html`).
3. Create a new folder named `assets` and place a new `style.css` file in it.
4. Create a new folder inside of your `assets` folder called `styles` and place yet another `style.css` file inside of it.
5. In your `index.html` file, create three links, each pointing to a different `style.css` file.
