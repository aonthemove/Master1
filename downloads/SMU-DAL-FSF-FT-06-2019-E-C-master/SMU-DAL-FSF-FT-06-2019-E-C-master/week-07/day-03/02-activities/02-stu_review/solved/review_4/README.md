# CSS Combinators Review Activity

## Instructions

**_Activity Four:_**

Editing only the CSS file, `style.css`, you'll be practicing using various selectors by filling in the blanks. As you fill in the blank for each problem, run the `index.html` file in the browser so you can see the changes taking place.

1. Select all `p` tags within `#sibling-1`
2. The `<h3>` tag is an immediate child of the div, `#sibling-1`. Select all `<h3>` tags. 
3. Select the `<div>` element with the id of `#sibling-1` and its adjacent sibling, `#sibling-2`
4. Select `#sibling-1` and the element's sibling, #sibling-4
5. Select `<p>`, `<h3>`, and `<h4>` tags
