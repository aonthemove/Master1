# Modify a Website

## Instructions

For the next 10 minutes, take a website that you commonly use (Amazon, Huffington Post, etc.) and heavily modify it using the Chrome Developer Tools. Really get creative here!

Be sure to at least modify:

* Content (Change words)
* Colors (Background)
* Spacing (Between any elements of your choosing)
* Images

Slack out a screenshot of both websites as you complete each one.

## Challenge

Modify the font color, weight, and size of the text on the website.

To any image on the site, add a box shadow.(Hint: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow)
