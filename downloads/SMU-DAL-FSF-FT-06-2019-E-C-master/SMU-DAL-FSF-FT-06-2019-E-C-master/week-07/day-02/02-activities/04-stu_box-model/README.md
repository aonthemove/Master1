# Box Model

## Instructions

In this activity, we'll take a look at each CSS property associated with the box model.

Open `index.html` in your browser. Note how BOX 1 and BOX 2 appear.

1. In `style.css` add `border: 3px solid #353f4f;` to both `.box1` and `.box2`.

Refresh the page in chrome and discuss the changes with your partner. 

2. In `style.css` add `width: 300px;` to both `.box1` and `.box2`.

Refresh the page in chrome and discuss the changes with your partner.

3. In `style.css` add `padding: 30px;` to `.box1`.

Refresh the page in chrome and discuss the changes with your partner. What will happen if we add `padding: 50px;` to `.box2`?

4. Add `padding: 50px;` to `.box2`.

Refresh the page in chrome and discuss the changes with your partner. Are the widths of the boxes the same? Why or why not?

5. Add `box-sizing: border-box;` to both `.box1` and `.box2`. 

Refresh the page in chrome and discuss the changes with your partner. Are the widths of the boxes the same? What do you think `box-sizing: border-box` means?

6. Add `margin: 20px;` to `.box1` and `margin: 30px;` to `.box2`.

Refresh the page in chrome and discuss the changes with your partner. What does margin do?

## Challenge

Google to find how you can set just the padding above an element. How about to the left? How can you individually set the top, right, bottom, and left padding on an element in a single line?
