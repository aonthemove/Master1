For tonight's homework complete the following:

- In your browser, navigate to `https://reqres.in/`. This is a REST API with the express purpose of being used for testing.
- Read the documentation for what endpoints are available on the API
- Use Postman to make a request to each endpoint.

Reading documentation and understanding how an API functions is a key part of being a web developer. Being able to do so not only helps you to use APIs another has written, but also to document an API that you write so that others can use it effectively.

Once you've finished looking at the API, read this article on HTTP status codes:

Don't just skim through it. Really read it. Are there words you don't know? Look them up; see what new articles you find to read. 

You don't need to know all of this intimately at this point, but the better you understand the tools at your disposal, the more easily and eloquently you'll be able to solve problems in the future.
