Student Guidelines: 

1. Must have a Slideshow presentation! 

1. Consider the structure of your presentation (Make sure that it is not completely demo focused. A short demonstration of the working application will suffice.)

1. Be able to communicate how the application works to all audiences.

1. Do not dive too heavily into the code: focus on a few points that you were proud of, and/or bits that were challenging, such as an algorithm that you wrote that you feel was pivotal to the functioning of your application.

1. Consider the flow of the presentation (does it flow logically?)

* What is your application?
* How did you go about building it (architectural decisions)?
* Why did you build the application this way?
* Demonstration of the application
* Talk about the status of client requirements: (did you fall short, meet, or exceed requirements?)
* What challenges did you run into? How did you overcome them?
* What improvements would you make next?
