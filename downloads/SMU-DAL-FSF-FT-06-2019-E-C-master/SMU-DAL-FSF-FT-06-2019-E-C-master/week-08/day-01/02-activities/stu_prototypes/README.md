# Prototype Creation Activity

## Instructions:

Working with your partner(s), think of an object that could be created from a class that extends another class.

Write the code to create those classes and instantiate an object from them. A good tip to keep in mind as you are working on this activity is how objects can be related to each other and in what ways certain objects are different.

Hint: Think about vehicles! Within the category of vehicles, you might have cars, trains, and airplanes. Within cars, you can make coupes, sedans, or SUVs. Within sedans, you could have a Ford Taurus, Honda Accord, or a Toyota Camry.
